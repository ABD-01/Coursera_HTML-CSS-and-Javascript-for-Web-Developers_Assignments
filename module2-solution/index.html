          <h3>Solid</h3>
          <p>
            A solidâ€™s particles are packed closely together. The forces between the particles are strong enough that the particles cannot move freely; they can only vibrate. As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape and a definite volume. Solids can only change shape under force, as when broken or cut.

      <!-- Liquid -->

          <h3>Liquid</h3>
          <p>
            Liquids have definite volume (does not change) if the temperature and pressure are constant.
Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are such that the molecules have enough energy to move around, which makes the structure mobile.
This means that a liquid is not definite in shape but rather conforms to the shape of its container.

      <!-- Gas -->

        <div>
          <h3>Gaseous</h3>
          <p>
            Gas molecules have either very weak bonds or no bonds at all, so they can move freely and quickly.
Gas molecules have enough kinetic energy that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero, for an ideal gas),
and they are spaced very far apart from each other.
